# NgFundamentals

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

Angular has become one of the most widely used web development frameworks. [This course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/description), Angular Fundamentals, will teach you the fundamentals of writing applications with Angular - whether or not you've had past experience with Angular 1. You will learn how to bootstrap an application and how to build pages and reusable elements using Angular Components and the new Angular syntax. You'll also learn the fundamentals of: routing, creating reusable services and dependency injection, building forms with validation, and communicating with the server using HTTP and observables. You'll even learn how to test all of this using unit tests and end-to-end UI tests. When you finish this course, you will have the fundamental knowledge necessary to create professional and personal websites using Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
